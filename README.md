## How to change background image with local source?
> â€žThis is not possible. The application front end does not have filesystem access due to security problems that may arise from it. Theoretically this can be re-enabled with a plugin. But the use-case is very niche, and you are likely better off just using an online host.â€œ - RDG-01, Theme developer

## How to change background image via online link?
The easiest solution to change the background image by changing url('') with the source URL of your image</br>
Be aware that when the image from online source gets deleted, you won't get to see the theme in Discord anymore.

- Find an image online and get it's source URL (For verification, make sure the ending of URL is .jpg, which leads to an image, not a website)
- Replace the background-image property url('') to your image URL

```
--background-image: url('https://wallpapers.com/images/hd/purple-cool-sqcgvfwstpv5gv4j.jpg');
```

- Save the code and upload it back to the folder - repeat steps in **Installation** part

## How to change background image via GitHub repository?
Harder and much longer way to change background image, but more efficient, because the online source can be deleted at any time, while your repository is here forever

- Upload your image to own GitHub repository of your choice (e.g. your account name "Jason", repository "JasonBack", image "PurpBack.jpg")
- Replace the link property to your own values

```
--background-image: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason/JasonBack/main/PurpBack.jpg');
```

- Save the code and upload it back to the folder - repeat steps in **Installation** part
